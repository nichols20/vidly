/*created Route element with the path /movies which will display the movies component when the url equals the designated
path. I realized the NavBar will be seperate from the content created so I created a navbar component to keep the code
related together in the same place and clean. I then created A route for the exact path '/' and added a reirect to 
the movies route this is so Users that traverse to the home url will get redirected to the movies route. I then added 
a not-found route and redirect the redirect is incase a given url does not match any defined it will return the not-found
route which will render an h1 stating the page isn't found. */
